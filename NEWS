farstream 0.1.1 (February 20, 2012)
===================================

- Initial release of Farstream
- Not parallel installable with Farsight2
- Added GObject Introspection annotations
- Added parser functions for the GstMessages
- shm transmiiter:Add a property to control the maximum bufferring time
- API changes from Farsight2:

 * Remove the "error" signal from the participants (they have no
   methods, no behavior, and emit no errors)
 * Remove the "cname" parameter from the participant constructor and
   make the "cname" property specific to RTP and remove it from
   fs_conference_new_participant()
 * Remove the debug msg in the error messages
 * Remove the special hack for ptime in FsCodec and make it a regular
   parameter
 * Pass sdes struct as-is to fsrtpconference
 * Replace FS_DTMF_METHOD_IN_BAND with FS_DTMF_METHOD_SOUND
 * Return NULL in "codecs" unless they are ready (and "codecs-ready"
   is not needed anymore)
 * Replace set_candidates by add_candidates and use force_candidates
   for rawudp
 * Set transmitter after creating stream
   * Fixes possible race: One has a session with one stream, the user
     creates a new stream, then packets in the new stream come in
     (with the new stream's cname/ssrc) before the "src-pad-added"
     signal is connected... ie doesn't link... failure
     ensues.... solution? Giving the user a chance to link
     src-pad-added before setting the transmitter ?
 * Remove fs-interfaces (moved to libnice)
 * Renamed fs-enum-types.h to fs-enumtypes.h for consistency
 * Renamed fs-conference-iface.h to fs-conference.h
 * Rename fs_stream_get_src_pads_iterator() to
   fs_stream_iterate_src_pads() for consistency
 * Remove the FS_ERROR_UNKNOWN_CNAME error entirely
 * Add a _destroy method to session/stream and have the parent keep a
   ref.. so the session/stream need to be destroyed/closed and we can
   simplify the teardown code quite a bit
 * Moved the header files from <gst/farsight/.. to <farstream/...> 

- Now requires gst-plugins-bad 0.10.23
